        What is UPSC ?
      </h2>
      <br class="app__description" id="science__description">
        <!-- Content -->
        Commonly known as UPSC Exam or IAS Exam, the UPSC Civil Services Examination(CSE) is one of the examinations conducted by the Union Public Service Commission to recruit suitable candidates into civil services of India including IAS, IPS, IFS, and other allied services. The examination is conducted in three phases namely UPSC Prelims, UPSC Main, and the personality Test or UPSC Interview.
        <br><br>
        The first phase of IAS Exam is UPSC Preliminary Examination which is the screening test and thus is qualifying in nature. The score obtained in the UPSC Prelims exam is not calculated in the final merit. However, the score in GS Paper-I is essential to determine the cutoff of UPSC Prelims Exam. The IAS Prelims Exam paper consists of two papers that are objective-type MCQ-based as opposed to UPSC Civil Services Mains Exam. The UPSC Mains Exam is a descriptive exam consisting of nine papers.

        In this article, we will discuss what is the UPSC exam, eligibility, IAS exam syllabus, UPSC Exam pattern, and other important details related to IAS Exam.

        Subjects To Study For NEET ?
      </h2>
      <br class="app__description" id="science__description">
        <!-- Content -->
        There are some subjects which are more scoring than others. However, if we see the broader picture, IAS toppers have scored 320+ in both technical and non-technical subjects. The reason why some subjects are perceived as low scoring is that candidates are not able to put in the requisite effort or they have selected an optional subject which isn’t right for them. Technical subjects (such as Mathematics) can fetch you high marks as the answers are absolute. Basically, unlike humanities subjects, the examiner’s biases or preferences have less of a role to play.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, non-technical subjects, especially those which have some overlap with the GS syllabus, give more preparation time and reading material overall, thus increasing the overall Mains score if studied well. There are many factors to decide which is the best optional subject in UPSC. Before deciding on a subject, a candidate must ask herself/himself the following six questions.
