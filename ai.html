        Important Questions & Answers
      </h2>

        <h3>Q1. What is Artifical Intelligence ?</h3>
        <br>
        Ans - Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Q2. Give Some Examples of AI </h3>
        <br>
        Ans - Examples of AI are speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Q3. How Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning differ from each other?</h3>
        <br>
        Ans - Machine learning is a subset of AI, and it consists of the techniques that enable computers to figure things out from the data and deliver AI applications. Deep learning, meanwhile, is a subset of machine learning that enables computers to solve more complex problems.
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>Q4. What’s the difference between strong AI and weak AI?</h3>
        <br>
        Ans - The difference between the two is just like the terms sound. Strong AI can successfully imitate human intelligence and is at the core of advanced robotics. Weak AI can only predict specific characteristics that resemble human intelligence. Alexa and Siri are excellent examples of weak AI. Strong AI Can be applied widely Extensive scope Human-level intelligence Processes data by using clustering and association Weak AI Can be great at performing some simple tasks
        Uses both supervised and unsupervised learning
        The scope can be minimal
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>Q5. What’s a Turing test?</h3>
        <br>
        Ans - The Turing test, named after Alan Turing, is a method of testing a machine’s human-level intelligence. For example, in a human-versus-machine scenario, a judge will be tasked with identifying which terminal was occupied by a human and which was occupied by a computer based on individual performance.
