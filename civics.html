        Important Questions & Answers

        <h3>Q1. Why were images and symbols used in the eighteenth century France ?</h3>
        <br>
        Ans - The majority of men and women in 18th century France could not read and write. So images and symbols were frequently used instead of printed words to communicate important ideas.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Q2. Describe the incidents that led to the storming of the Bastille.</h3>
        <br>
        Ans - While the National Assembly was busy at Versailles drafting a constitution, the rest of France was seething with turmoil. A severe winter had meant a bad harvest, the price of bread rose. Often bakers exploited the situation and hoarded supplies. After spending hours in long queues at the bakery, crowds of angry women stormed into the shops. At the same time, the king ordered troops to move into Paris. On 14 July, the agitated crowd stormed and destroyed Bastille
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Q3. State the election process of the National Assembly in France.</h3>
        <br>
        Ans - The constitution of 1791 vested the power to make laws in the National Assembly, which was indirectly elected. Citizens voted for a group of electors, who in turn close the assembly. All citizens did not have the right to vote. Only men above 25 years of age who paid taxes equal to at least 3 days of a labourer’s wage were given the status of active citizens, that is, they were entitled to vote. The remaining men and all women were classed as passive citizens. To qualify as an elector and then as a member of the assembly, a man had to belong to the highest bracket of tax payers.
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>Q4. The central location of India at the head of the Indian Ocean is considered of great significance. Why?</h3>
        <br>
        Ans - The trans-Indian Ocean routes which connect the countries of Europe in the West and the countries of East Asia provide a strategic central location to India.
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>Q5. The sun rises two hours earlier in Arunachal Pradesh as compared to Gujarat in the west but the watches show the same time. How does this happen?</h3>
        <br>
        Ans - From Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh, there is a time lag of two hours, but the watches show the same time because the time along the Standard Meridian of India (82° 30’E) passing through Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh is taken as the standard time for the whole country. Because the same standard time for the whole country has been adopted, the watches show the same time in Arunachal Pradesh, Gujarat, and in all parts of the country.
