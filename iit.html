        What is IIT ?
      </h2>
      <br class="app__description" id="science__description">
        <!-- Content -->
        The Indian Institutes of Technology are autonomous public technical universities located across India. It is under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Education, Government of India. The vision for establishing IITs was to build some world class institutions in India so that our people can learn and become good in this field.Also, India's economy was in its nacent stages because few years after independence, first IIT, IIT Kharagpur was built. The main focus was to build engineers which can later on work in manufacturing sectors, start new companies and employ others, basically, make a huge contribution in the Indian economy.<br><br>
        
        Now, IIT should make world class engineers (literally), but it is left behind by the “world class mark” by a large gap. This is because most of the students take jobs in analytics, consulting, finance, operations, product analyst and many more roles which have no relation to engineering in literal terms. We are not encouraged to build products, we are encouraged to “get a good CGPA” - which is important, but not by learning and understanding, but by rotting and vomiting into he exams.

        But, and I say the but loudly, there are some students who are so much into their subjects that they find one way or the other to pursue that and become a class engineer, so all those students are the ones justifying being in IIT.
